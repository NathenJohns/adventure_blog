# Adventure Blog
Adventure Blog - Code Institute Project 4

This milestone project, as part of the Code Institute curriculum, was created for the sole purpose of users building and editing Adventures centered around Travel and then writing articles about their exploits.

I chose this as my project material as I am an avid traveller myself and am currently writing my own articles with my Brother for future Blog/Vlog aspirations.

A user is able to create countries into the database (if they are not currently available) and use these to build Adventures containing mulitple countries.

In it's current form the website does not have full functionality with login or sign-up processes (as this was not required in the brief), therefore all articles, adventures and countries can be viewed, edited and deleted, regardless of who made them.

In future, myself or other developers can amend this so that only users who created or wrote articles/adventures can amend or delete them but still be viewed by everyone else. As mentioned above, this was not a requirement for the course.

# Development Process
## Automated Testing

## Manual Testing
Testing for this project was kept within the Code Editor (Cloud9) and when deployed on Google Chrome using their dev tools.

As the code is interactive and requires Javascript, dev tools on Google Chrome was used to work and test functionality and the Console (using Console Log) within the code was used
to see if the progam ran into errors. There was regular use of trial and error.

This site was tested across multiple browsers (Chrome, Safari, Internet Explorer, FireFox) and on multiple mobile devices (iPhone 4, 5, 7: Chrome and Safari, iPad, Samsung Galaxy) to ensure compatibility and responsiveness.


# Features

# Known Issues
The datepicker when creating or updating an adventure does not work as effectively as it has done previously when clicking to open. This is solely a Chrome issue; the datepicker works perfectly on other browsers such as Firefox or Edge.

If using Chrome, however, the user will have to right click the datepicker to open.

# Installation

If you're interested in cloning this repository then you are able to do so using the following [link](https://github.com/NathenJohns/adventure_blog) and then cloning the code.

The backend code is found in the run.py file and to run this code make sure to be on the run.py page and click Run at the top of Cloud9 which will open the server with a link to https://adventure-blog-njohns93.c9users.io

Alternatively, open the command line and enter 'python3 run.py' and this will open a link to the production site.

The databse is found on [Mlab](https://mlab.com/login/) so this database will have to be recreated in order to get the full functionality.
