# Adventure Blog

## MLAB for MongoDB checks
To correct the Datetime for the Articles and Adventures, access to MLAB (https://mlab.com/login/) needs to be granted: the username is NathenJohns and the password: woodstock21.

Access the Collections by clicked adventure_blog and then articles or adventures depending on which is being fixed as both require datetime.

The backend code is found in the run.py file and to run this code make sure to be on the run.py page and click Run at the top of Cloud9 which will open the server with a link to https://adventure-blog-njohns93.c9users.io

## Checks
The datepicker when creating or updating an adventure does not work as effectively as it has done previously when clicking to open. This is solely a Chrome issue; the datepicker works perfectly on other browsers such as Firefox or Edge.

If using Chrome, however, the user will have to right click the datepicker to open.
